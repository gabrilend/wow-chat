# wow-chat
collection of eluna scripts for azerothcore that do stuff. the goal is to turn WoW into a roguelike with an emphasis on chatting with your friends.

I'm picturing a server where you can chat with your friends and it'd spawn 
monsters for you to fight and you could level up without going anywhere. That 
way people could just pick an environment they liked (like a background in a 
chat application) and then it'd spawn monsters you could fight based on what 
"mood" it estimated you were in. Like the game would react to your chat messages
by spawning in quests, monsters, even PvP opportunities. Sorta like guided 
storytelling. And it'd have all the variables it needed to generate randomized 
NPCs and quests - just spawn in the objective somewhere over that hill and tell 
the player to get to it. It could develop long term meta stories that would be 
interesting to engage with even while solo.
