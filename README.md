first read periodic_events.lua.
Understand it, then move on to treasure.lua.
Then, check out traveller.lua
and finally ambush.lua.
Everything else is non-functional.

Every time you see a function called from the "movement" or "tempo/tide"

PS: you'll appreciate using Vimfolds, it makes it a lot easier to understand
